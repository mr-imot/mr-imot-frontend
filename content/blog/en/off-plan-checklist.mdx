Buying before a building is finished is normal in Bulgaria. These three quick checks protect you while keeping the process fast and friendly.

## 1) Verify the developer

- Ask for the company UIC and check it in the Commercial Register.
- Confirm the exact project company (SPV) that will sign the contract.
- Check their previous buildings: delivered on time? same architect? same materials?

<Callout type="warning" title="If you can’t verify the company">
  Do not pay a reservation fee until you see the UIC and a simple track record. A serious developer will share this upfront.
</Callout>

## 2) Confirm permits and build stage

- Request the building permit and current construction stage.
- Ask for the structural engineer and architect names; Google them for past work.
- Make sure the project address and cadastral ID match what you see on-site.

## 3) Protect your payment schedule

- Avoid paying more than **20% before Act 14** (structure complete).
- Link each payment to a milestone (Act 14, Act 15, Act 16).
- Use an escrow account for the biggest payment if possible.

<Callout type="success" title="Simple rule of thumb">
  Small deposit, milestone payments, and the largest payment only after Act 15/16 keeps everyone safe.
</Callout>
