**Important:** The fees in the calculator are converted to euros for 2026 at an exchange rate of 1 BGN = 0.5114 EUR. The calculator is regularly updated for changes in legislation and exchange rates. **Last updated: December 21, 2025.**

## What Does the Calculator Calculate?

The calculator automatically calculates:

- **VAT on Notary Fee** – 20% of the notary fee (if the notary is VAT registered)
- **Municipal Acquisition Tax** – local tax that varies by municipality (usually 2-3%)

## How Does the Calculation Work?

### Notary Fee

Calculated according to the official Tariff for Notary Fees under ЗННД. The tariff is regressive – the higher the price, the lower the percentage, but the amount increases.

**Examples (converted to EUR at rate 1 BGN = 0.5114 EUR):**
- For amounts up to ~51,140 EUR (100,000 BGN): ~0.5-0.8% of value
- For amounts over ~255,700 EUR (500,000 BGN): maximum fee ~3,068 EUR (6,000 BGN)

### Municipal Tax

The amount varies by municipality:
- **Sofia, Plovdiv, Varna, Burgas:** 3%
- **Pleven:** 2.85%
- **Sliven:** 2.8%
- **Other municipalities:** 2-3% (full list in calculator)

### Registration Fee

Fixed at 0.1% of material interest, but not less than ~5.11 EUR (10 BGN). Paid to the Registry Agency.

**Important:** All amounts in the calculator are converted to euros at an exchange rate of 1 BGN = 0.5114 EUR, current for 2026. We will continue to update the calculator for changes in legislation and exchange rates. Last updated: December 21, 2025.

### Material Interest

Material interest is the higher value between:
- The sale price (contract price)
- The tax assessment of the property

The calculator uses this value to calculate all fees.

**Recommendation:** Always request a preliminary invoice from the notary before the transaction.

### Who Pays the Fees When Buying Property?
