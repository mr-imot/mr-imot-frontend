## Step 1: Find the "Add Property" Button

Adding a listing is done from the "Add Property" button, which is visible after you log in with your account. Alternatively, you can use the side menu: "Properties" → "Add Property".

## Step 2: Fill in the Data

Carefully fill in all the data for your property.

**IMPORTANT:** On Mister Imot, you publish the entire project. In the description, you can describe in detail which individual apartments or houses you have available. This way, you will avoid uploading multiple separate listings and can easily edit the information.

The idea is for buyers to find your property directly and contact you - no intermediaries, no commissions.

## Step 3: Price and Location

- The listed price is per square meter
- If you don't want to add a price, check the "Price on request" option
- Select the exact location on the map
- Add quality photos of the property

## Step 4: Publishing

After you click the "Create Project" button, your listing will be visible in the side menu "Properties", where you can make edits at any time.

## How to Edit a Listing?

Editing a listing is very easy:

1. **Log into your profile** and go to the side menu "Properties"
2. **Find the listing** you want to edit in your list of listings
3. **Click on the listing** and select the "Edit" option
4. **Make the necessary changes** - you can update:
   - Title and description
   - Price and location
   - Photos
   - All other details
5. **Save the changes** - after clicking "Save changes", the listing will be updated immediately

All your listings are accessible for editing at any time from your profile. This allows you to update the information when you have new available apartments or when you change prices.
