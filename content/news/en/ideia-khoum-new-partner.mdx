**SOFIA Building:** An avant-garde project in the capital's center (near "Medical University" metro station). The building combines luxury residential spaces with a medical center, suspended ventilated facade, and uncompromising sound and thermal insulation. "SOFIA" is a symbol of the convenience of the ideal center.

**SHEPA:** An architectural phenomenon with a unique Y-shaped structure and a facade made of steel alloy (corten). The project is defined as "architectural empathy" – a building that encourages social interaction, merges with "Kukuryak" Park, and offers interior solutions in an industrial style, vertical gardens, and a multifunctional event hall.
