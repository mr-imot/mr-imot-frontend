Property Register and Tax Office: How to protect and register your property?

After you've chosen your dream home, it's time for legal verification and administrative processing. The Property Register and the Tax Office are the two institutions that guarantee your property is yours and "clean" of problems.

In this article, we'll examine how to check for encumbrances, what a Simple Written Inquiry (SWI) is, and what your obligations to the tax authorities are in 2026.

## 1. Registry Agency: Property Register

The Registry Agency (RA) maintains the Property Register – a public database where all circumstances related to real estate are recorded (sales, mortgages, prohibitions, claims).

### Encumbrance Check: Why is it mandatory?

Never buy a property without obtaining an Encumbrance Certificate. It shows whether the property has:

- Active mortgages.
- Prohibitions (seizures by enforcement agents).
- Registered claims (ownership disputes).

### Simple Written Inquiry (SWI) vs. Certificate

**Simple Written Inquiry (SWI):** This is a quick and cheap way (about 4-5 BGN fee) to check the property online through the Agency's portal. It gives you current information on screen, but has no evidentiary value before a bank or court.

**Encumbrance Certificate:** An official document signed by a registration judge. Issued within 3 or 7 business days and is mandatory for banks when granting a loan.

## 2. The Notarial Act and VAT on Fees

Many buyers are surprised when they see the final bill at the notary. It's important to know:

**VAT on notarial fees:** If the notary is VAT-registered (most are), they charge 20% VAT on their service. This VAT is paid by the buyer and is added to the standard tariff fee.

**Registration:** The notary is required to submit the notarial act to the Registry Agency on the day of the transaction. Only after this registration do you become the official owner before third parties.

## 3. Tax Office: Property Declaration

After purchase, you have a legal obligation to declare the property to the municipality where it is located.

### Deadline and Procedure 2026

**Deadline:** 2 months from the date of the transaction (Art. 14 of the Local Taxes and Fees Act).

**Automatic notification:** In most major cities (Sofia, Plovdiv), notaries submit information to the tax authorities automatically. However, it is strongly recommended to verify whether registration is complete and to submit a declaration in person if you are entitled to relief.

### Tax Relief

**Primary residence:** If you declare the property as your primary residence, you pay 50% less building tax.

**Persons with reduced working capacity (PWD):** The tax for primary residence is reduced by 75%.

### What to check at the Tax Office (MDT)?

Before purchase, request from the seller a Tax Assessment Certificate. It proves two things:

1. The property is registered and has no accumulated tax liabilities.
2. The tax assessment is the base below which the transaction price cannot fall for taxation purposes.
