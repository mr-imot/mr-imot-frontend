Following the successful launch of the [Russian version](/news/mister-imot-now-speaks-russian), **Mister Imot now speaks Greek**. We worked hard to open our projects to another neighboring market and make cross-border deals simpler.

## Why Greece?

- Greek buyers are steadily increasing their interest in new-build homes in Bulgaria.
- Many Bulgarians are looking for vacation homes in Greece.
- Adding Greek removes friction so builders, investors, and buyers connect directly—no intermediaries, no extra fees.

## What this means for you

- All platform projects are now available for **Greek buyers**.
- Bulgarian developers can present their projects to a new audience immediately.
- Greek users can browse **direct-from-builder listings**, check locations, and connect directly.

## More content and support

We’re publishing regular articles, analyses, and guides about **real estate**, **new construction trends**, investment opportunities, and practical tips for buyers and builders. This helps both local and international clients make confident decisions.

Our mission stays the same: a **clear, transparent property market** where customers talk to the actual builder, not an intermediary.

Thank you for being part of Mister Imot. More updates are coming soon.
