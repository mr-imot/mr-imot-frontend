We launched a full Russian version of the platform—listings, news, articles, and builder dashboards are now in Russian. We’ve worked hard on the translation and are opening to a new market.

## What’s included

- Navigation, search, and all pages fully in Russian.
- **New‑build listings** can be browsed by Russian-speaking buyers without intermediaries.
- The builder dashboard is fully in Russian so you can manage projects confidently.

## If you spot an issue

Message us via [Contact](/contact)—every bit of feedback helps us improve.

## For developers

Have a new-build project? Publish it directly and it will automatically be visible to Russian buyers. Keep your listings fresh—it’s now even easier.

## What’s next

We’re adding more Russian content and preparing the next language soon. Thank you for being part of Mister Imot!
