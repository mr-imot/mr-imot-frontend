Investing is no longer just for high earners. Technology has removed barriers so anyone can start with small amounts—if they have the willingness and a bit of financial literacy. That’s the view of finance professional **Vladimir Zhivaga** in a Bloomberg TV Bulgaria interview.

## Investing is accessible to everyone

Online platforms enable purchases of global assets, including **fractional shares**. Markets that once felt distant now fit in a smartphone.

Zhivaga’s core advice is simple: **learn what risk is, what return is, and how investments work.** That’s enough to begin—even with 20–30 leva a month.

## ETFs, bonds, or a savings account?

Comparing a **100 leva monthly contribution for 5 years**:

- **Savings account:** about **6,000 leva**
- **Bond ETF:** a bit higher return
- **Global ETF (MSCI World):** over **7,300 leva**

The gap is roughly **18%**—enough to offset inflation and grow capital in real terms.

## Bulgarians and investing—change is underway

Traditionally, Bulgarians favor “hard” assets like property, gold, and deposits. That profile is shifting:

- more young people are investing;
- rising interest in **ETFs**, **bonds**, and **European funds**;
- defense sector attention after the war in Ukraine.

Many analysts also expect a market correction, making bonds look more attractive.

## What euro adoption could change

- no FX conversion costs;
- easier access to European ETFs;
- clearer savings management in a single currency.

## Financial literacy: the first step

Freedom24 runs trainings and is building a game that explains ETFs and the basics of investing. “Understand the principles and the rest becomes logical,” Zhivaga says.

## Takeaway

Investing isn’t arcane or reserved for big earners. Even **100 leva a month** can compound meaningfully when invested wisely.
