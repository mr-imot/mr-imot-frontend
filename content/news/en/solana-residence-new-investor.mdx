A new residential project has joined Mister Imot's selection – **Solana Residence**, located in Ovcha Kupel 2 district, Sofia. The project is now published on the platform and is offered directly by the investor, without intermediaries and without commission.

Solana Residence is a residential building under construction, with sales currently off-plan, with planned completion in 2028. According to the investor, prices are fixed and without indexation, which is guaranteed in contracts with clients. The project has a valid Building Permit and complete project documentation.

The homes are designed with an emphasis on functional layouts and natural lighting, with most apartments having southern exposure. Modern architecture, ventilated facade, and solutions for high energy efficiency are planned.

The project is located on "Industrialna" Street in Ovcha Kupel 2, approximately 2 minutes walk from "Ovcha Kupel 2" metro station, with convenient access to New Bulgarian University, educational and healthcare institutions, as well as commercial facilities.

With the inclusion of Solana Residence, Mister Imot continues to expand its portfolio of verified projects, published directly by builders and investors, with the aim of greater transparency and easier access to new construction without intermediaries.
