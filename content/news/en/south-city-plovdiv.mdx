## 🔍 Where in Plovdiv can you still find a “sensible” off-plan home?

Local agents point to several areas that still fit a **mid-range budget**:

- **Ostromila**
- **Belomorski**
- New buildings at the edge of **Hristo Smirnenski**
- Projects **opposite the new campus of Plovdiv University**

Brokers Borislav Simeonov and Ginka Zhelyazkova call these the **most promising off-plan zones**, but note lagging infrastructure: few green spaces, limited retail, and heavy traffic.

## 📈 How prices moved in 2025

- **Start of 2025:** ~**€1,000/sq.m** in the new southern zones.  
- **Mid-year:** about **20%** growth.  
- **November 2025:** stabilization.

Today:

- Standard off-plan new builds: **€1,300–1,400/sq.m** (area-dependent).  
- Higher-end units: up to **€2,000/sq.m**.

## 🤝 Sellers vs. buyers: “We’ll wait for next year”

Classic expectation standoff:

- Buyers: **“We’ll buy next year when prices drop.”**  
- Sellers: **“We’ll sell next year when prices rise.”**

Experts say the **currency change on Jan 1 won’t trigger sudden price swings**.

## 🎈 Is there a bubble?

Brokers say **no**. Rising services, materials, and build costs mean the square-meter price **isn’t artificially inflated**.

## 🔮 What to expect in 2026

- **Q1:** fewer deals, more wait-and-see.  
- **Q2:** normalization and real transactions returning.

No drama expected—**neither a crash nor an explosive spike**. More likely a steady glide, supported by new projects and expansion in the South.

## 🏡 Conclusion

Plovdiv remains one of Bulgaria’s most active markets. Off-plan buys stay logical for mid budgets, but infrastructure lags. “Should I wait?” has no universal answer, yet experts agree: **prices are unlikely to collapse next year**.
