**Cost Calculator 2026:** What fees are paid when buying property and who pays them?

Planning a budget for a new home doesn't end with the agreed price with the seller. Buyers often forget about the so-called additional costs in property transactions, which can reach between 4% and 6% of the transaction value.

In this article, we'll examine in detail all notary fees, local taxes, and bank costs for 2026, so you're financially prepared.

## Main costs in property transactions

When transferring real estate in Bulgaria, three main state and municipal fees are paid. They are calculated on the **material interest** (the higher value between the sale price and the tax assessment).

### 1. Local Tax (Acquisition Tax)

This is the largest expense. Its amount is determined individually by each municipality.

- **For Sofia:** 3%
- **For Plovdiv:** 3%
- **For Varna:** 3%
- **For Burgas:** 3%

*(Note: Values are current as of 2025/2026, but always check for updates in the specific municipality).*

### 2. Notary Fee

It is determined by the Tariff for Notary Fees under the Notaries and Notarial Activity Act. The fee is **regressive** – the higher the price, the lower the percentage, but the amount increases.

### 3. Registration Fee

Paid to the Registry Agency. It is fixed at **0.1%** of the material interest, but not less than 10 BGN.

## Who pays the fees when buying property?

According to Art. 186 of the Obligations and Contracts Act (ЗЗД), the costs of the sale are divided equally between the parties, unless otherwise agreed.

**In practice however:**

- In 90% of cases in Bulgaria, **the buyer pays all fees** (local tax, notary fee, and registration fee).
- If the property is purchased through a broker, each party usually pays their commission to their agency.

## Additional bank and mortgage costs

If you're buying with a loan, your property purchase fee calculator should include:

- **Property valuation fee:** Around 200 – 400 BGN (paid to an external appraiser).
- **Document review fee:** Varies by bank (often a fixed amount or percentage).
- **Notary fee for mortgage establishment:** Calculated on the loan amount.
- **Property insurance and life insurance:** Mandatory for mortgage loans.

## Example: How much does it cost to transfer a 100,000 euro property in Plovdiv?

Let's calculate the costs for an apartment priced at 200,000 BGN (approx. 100,000 euros):

| Fee Type | Percentage/Formula | Approximate Amount |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Local Tax (Plovdiv)** | 3% | 6,000 BGN |
| **Notary Fee** | By tariff (+VAT) | ~1,200 - 1,500 BGN |
| **Registration Fee** | 0.1% | 200 BGN |
| **Notarial Deed Preparation** | By agreement | 200 - 500 BGN |
| **TOTAL** | **~3.9%** | **~7,900 BGN** |

## Specific cases: Gift and Parking Space

**Fee calculator for property gift:** If the gift is between relatives in direct line (parents-children), the local tax is 0%. If between siblings – about 0.7%.

**Notary fee calculator for parking space:** When buying a parking space or garage that is considered a separate object, fees are calculated the same way as for a residence.
